# Toyota Smarthome Untrimmed (TSU)

This code is for evaluating the Toyota Smarthome Untrimmed (TSU) dataset ([Project page](https://project.inria.fr/toyotasmarthome/)). 

## Abstract
We introduce a new untrimmed daily-living dataset that features several real-world challenges: Toyota Smarthome Untrimmed (TSU). TSU contains a wide variety of activities performed in a spontaneous manner. Activities are collected in real-world settings, which results in non-optimal viewpoints. The dataset contains dense annotations including elementary, composite activities and activities involving interaction with objects. We provide an analysis of the real-world challenges featured by TSU dataset, highlighting the open issues for detection algorithms. We show that the current state-of-the-art methods fail to achieve satisfactory performance on the TSU dataset.
